# You have rented some movies for your kids: 
# The little mermaid (for 3 days), 
# Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and 
# Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). 
# If price for a movie per day is 3 dollars, how much will you have to pay?


# Identify the data type of the following values:
# 99.9 = float
# "False" = string
# False = string
#'0' = string
#  0 = integer
# true = boolean
# 'true' = string
# [{}] = Dictionary
# {'a': []}

# Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: 
# Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour. 
# Google pays 400 dollars per hour, Amazon 380, and Facebook 350. 
# How much will you receive in payment for this week? 
# You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google and 4 hours for Amazon.
